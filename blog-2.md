## Handling Asynchronous Operations with Async/Await over Callbacks and Promises in TypeScript

### Introduction:
In TypeScript, managing asynchronous code can be challenging, especially with the readability and structure of code. Using async/await simplifies this by making asynchronous code appear synchronous, enhancing readability and organization.

### Challenges with Callbacks and Promises
Callbacks often lead to nested code, commonly known as "Callback Hell." While Promises improve this to some extent, handling complex asynchronous workflows can still be difficult.

### Benefits of Async/Await
With async/await, asynchronous code can be written in a more sequential manner, making it easier to understand and maintain. Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how async/await improves code clarity:

```typescript
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `fetchData` function looks and behaves like synchronous code, while still executing asynchronously. This approach reduces nesting and improves code readability.

### Conclusion
Using `async/await` in TypeScript enhances code readability and makes handling asynchronous operations simpler and more effective. It allows developers to write more manageable code, ultimately leading to a more efficient and organized codebase.
